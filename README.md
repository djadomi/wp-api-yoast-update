# WP API Yoast Update

WP API Yoast Update provides an easy way to update Yoast SEO fields (focus keyword, meta description) for posts using the WP REST API.

HTTP syntax:

``` http
POST {{host}}/wp-json/wp-api-yoast-update/v1/update
Authorization: Basic {{auth}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"post_id": 123,
	"focus_keyword": "thing I'm writing about",
	"meta_description": "This is a new meta description about the thing I'm writing about."
}
```

## WP CLI installation

```bash
wp plugin install https://github.com/djadomi/wp-api-yoast-update/releases/latest/download/wp-api-yoast-update.zip --activate
```

To update, add the `--force` flag to that command.

Note that there's no (simple) way to use `wp vhosts plugin` to install or update the plugin.

## _Raison d'Ãªtre_

The point of building this plugin was to provide a way to update Yoast SEO fields (focus keyword, meta description) for posts using the WP REST API. I was (am) building a post/page generator web app which creates posts and pages, and updates the WordPress blog using the WP API, but there is no built-in way to create or update Yoast `postmeta` in this context. This plugin provides a simple way to do that.
